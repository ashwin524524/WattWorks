Puzzle: Full Bridge Rectifier

Image: puzzle#6.png

Objective:
Place the missing diode (D1) to complete the full bridge rectifier. The diode must allow current to flow during the negative half-cycle.

Question:
Why is it important for a full bridge rectifier to have all four diodes properly connected?

Answer:
Without all four diodes, the circuit wonâ€™t rectify both halves of the AC signal, and the output won't be a full-wave DC signal.
